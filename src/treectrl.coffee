###
TreeCtrl controls TreePicker states: showing, unshowing, mixed for direct and indirect.

 Elements may be in one of these states:
   mixed      - some instances of the node class are selected, but not all
   unshowing  - there are instances but none are selected
   showing    - there are instances and all are selected
   abstract   - there are no instances (but presumably there are subs)
   (empty)    - is empty a better name for taxon with no direct members?
                Perhaps 'empty' is a legal direct-state and 'abstract' is only
                sensible as an indirect-state? Do these distinctions make
                sense in both the Taxon context and the Predicate context?

 What about these theoretical states?
   hidden     - TBD: not sure when hidden is appropriate
                perhaps abstract predicate subtrees should be hidden
                ie "there is nothing interesting here, move along"
   emphasized - TBD: mark the class of the focused_node


 Are these states only meaningful in the MVC View context and not the
 Model context? -- where the model context is Taxon and/or Predicate
 while the View context is the TreePicker.  Likewise 'collapse' is
 concept related to the View.  OK so we have View verbs such as:
 * hide
 * emphasize
 * collapse
 * pick (click?)
 and Model verbs such as:
